** UNSTABLE!
   This tool was fofrked an modified very quickly, there are some stuff untested. Use it at your own risk. If you find a bug, please consider filling an issue.

** [62%] What done at now and what to be done:
   - [X] Debian control generation(required minimum)
   - [X] Build architecture dependent(or independent) DEB package
   - [X] Shasums and GnuPG validation of source archives
   - [X] Changelog provision(DONE, but not tested)
   - [X] Package GnuPG signing
   - [X] Split packaging
   - [ ] Dependency resolution don't works if concrete version specified :: I need a parser for this
   - [ ] Documentation :: There will be a complete tutorial to start from the scratch

** Difference between Archlinux makepkg and makedebpkg
   - There are some options removed, because dpkg/apt doesn't support them:
     + asdeps
     + needed
   - There are come extra options added:
     + controlsource :: An array of /Something: Value/ that will be appended to DEBIAN/control's source section
     + controlpackage :: Same as /controlsource/, but for package section
