* makedebpkg

  It's a port of the Archlinux awesome [[https://projects.archlinux.org/pacman.git/tree/scripts/makepkg.sh.in][tool]] for creating packages.
  More info could be found at Archlinux [[https://wiki.archlinux.org][wiki]] on [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD][PKGBUILD]] and [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg][makepkg]] pages.

** UNSTABLE!
   This tool in active development at now. !MANY! features could be broken, so use it at your own risk!

** [%] What done at now and what to be done:
   - [X] Debian control generation(required minimum)
   - [X] Build architecture dependent(or independent) DEB package
   - [X] Shasums and GnuPG validation of source archives
   - [ ] Changelog provision(DONE, but not tested)
   - [ ] Building multiple packages(DONE, but not tested)
   - [ ] Package GnuPG signing
   - [ ] Documentation
   - [ ] Maybe I should keep this tool as separate patch for makepkg to simplify updates maintaining

** Difference between Archlinux makepkg and makedebpkg
   - There are some options removed, because dpkg/apt doesn't support them:
     + asdeps
     + needed
